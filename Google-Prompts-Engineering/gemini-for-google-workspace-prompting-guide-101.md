Writing effective prompts 

From the very beginning, Google Workspace was built to allow you to collaborate in real time with other people. 

Now, you can also collaborate with AI using Gemini for Google Workspace to help boost your productivity and 

creativity without sacrificing privacy or security. The embedded generative AI-powered features can help you 

write, organize information, create images, accelerate workflows, have richer meetings, and much more, all 

while using your favorite apps like Gmail, Google Docs, Google Drive, Google Sheets, Google Meet, Google 

Slides, and Gemini Advanced (the standalone chat experience available at gemini.google.com with enterprise-

grade security). Gemini is accessible right where you are doing your work — with access to your personal 

knowledge base in Drive, Docs, Gmail, and more — so you can enhance and create powerful workflows across 

the Workspace apps with less tab switching and interruption.

This guide provides you with the foundational skills to write effective prompts when using Gemini for Workspace. 

You can think of a prompt as a conversation starter with your AI-powered assistant. You might write several 

prompts as the conversation progresses. While the possibilities are virtually endless, you can put consistent 

best practices to work today. 

The four main areas to consider when writing an effective prompt are:
• 

 Persona 

• 

• 

• 

 Task 

 Context 

 Format 

Here is an example of a prompt using all four areas that could work well in Gmail and Google Docs: 

 You are a program manager in [industry].  Draft an executive summary email to  [persona] based on [details 

 about relevant program docs].  Limit to bullet points. 

You don’t need to use all four in every prompt, but using a few will help! Always remember to include a verb or 

command as part of your task; this is the most important component of a prompt.

Here are quick tips to get you started with Gemini for Google Workspace: 

1.  Use natural language. Write as if you’re speaking to another person. Express complete thoughts in  

full sentences.

2.  Be specific and iterate. Tell Gemini what you need it to do (summarize, write, change the tone, create). 

Provide as much context as possible.

3.  Be concise and avoid complexity. State your request in brief — but specific — language. Avoid jargon.

4.  Make it a conversation. Fine-tune your prompts if the results don’t meet your expectations or if you believe 

there’s room for improvement. Use follow-up prompts and an iterative process of review and refinement to 

yield better results.

5.  Use your documents. Personalize Gemini’s output with information from your own files in Google Drive.

6.  Make Gemini your prompt editor. When using Gemini Advanced, start your prompts with: “Make this a 

power prompt: [original prompt text here].” Gemini will make suggestions on how to improve your prompt. 

Ensure it says what you need, and then paste it back into Gemini Advanced to get an output.

Prompting is a skill we can all learn. You don’t have to be a prompt 
engineer to use generative AI. However, you will likely need to try a few 
different approaches for your prompt if you don’t get your desired 
outcome the first time. Based on what we’ve learned from our users 
so far, the most fruitful prompts average around 21 words with relevant 
context, yet the prompts people try are usually less than nine words.

Generative AI and all of its possibilities are exciting, but it’s still new. Even 
though our models are getting better every day, prompts can sometimes 
have unpredictable responses. 

Before putting an output from Gemini for Workspace into action, review it 
to ensure clarity, relevance, and accuracy. And of course, keep the most 
important thing in mind: Generative AI is meant to help humans but the 
final output is yours.

The example prompts in this guide are meant for illustrative purposes.

Introduction
Gemini for Google Workspace: Prompting 101

Gemini for Workspace is your AI-powered assistant integrated into the apps you use every day — Gmail, Google 

Docs, Google Sheets, Google Meet, Google Slides, and Gemini Advanced (the standalone chat experience 

available at gemini.google.com with enterprise-grade security). This means the apps you know and use will work 

together smoothly so you can collaborate with Gemini right where you are. You can have fewer interruptions to 

your focus and workflow, helping you complete tasks and do things you might not have initially known how to do. 

You can access the features of Gemini for Workspace in multiple ways. Engaging with Gemini in the side panel 

of your Workspace apps allows you to create highly personalized generative AI outputs that are based on your 

own files and documents — even if they aren’t Google Docs. You can generate personalized emails in seconds 

referencing your own Docs to pull in relevant context, generate Slides that are based on information directly  

from your own briefs or reports, and so much more. 

Understanding what makes an effective prompt and learning to craft prompts on the fly can boost your 

productivity and creativity. Gemini for Workspace can help you:

•  Improve your writing

•  Organize data

•  Create original images

•  Summarize information and surface insights 

•  Have better meetings with automatic note taking

•  Research unfamiliar topics easily

•  Spot trends, synthesize information, and identify business opportunities 

For 25 years, Google has built helpful, secure products that give users choice and control over their data. It’s a 

bedrock principle for us. This was the case back when we first launched Gmail in 2004, and it remains true in the 

era of generative AI. This means your data is your data and does not belong to Google. Your data stays in your 

Workspace environment. Your privacy is protected. Your content is never used for targeting ads or to train or 

improve Gemini or any other generative AI models.

the newly written guidance, you prompt Gemini in Google Docs. You type:

Take this content and turn it into a short blog with the title “Resolve Common Issues Without Agent 

Assistance.” Have separate sections for our return policy, our refund policy, and our store credit policy.

Now you want to create an email template that the team can use when they receive customer questions around 

these three areas. You open a new Google Doc and prompt Gemini in Docs using Help me write. You type: 

Draft an email template to a customer that highlights self-service resources referencing [blog link] for 

[support issues]. Thank the customer for their business and assure them of our commitment to meeting 

their needs. (Gemini in Docs)

Use case: Conduct voice of the customer research 

You want to email a dissatisfied customer to attempt to make things right. You open an email that includes a 

customer complaint. You prompt Gemini in Gmail by selecting Help me write. You type:

Request a follow-up conversation on [date] at [time] with this customer who provided negative feedback 

to understand their concern and offer resolutions. Include example solutions. (Gemini in Gmail) 

The drafted response is a nice start, but you want to refine the language. You iterate by prompting Gemini  

in Gmail using Refine and Elaborate. Next, you want to create a short survey that you can send after each  

follow-up customer call. You open a new Google Doc and prompt Gemini in Docs. You type: 

Create five different questions to customers who have just spoken to an agent on the phone. Questions 

should gauge how effective the call was, if the customer’s concern was addressed, and if they would 

recommend our business to others. (Gemini in Docs)

Use case: Conduct fundraising and investor relations 

You’re ready to reach out to potential investors to make your brick-and-mortar store a reality. You want help 

getting started on an email to investors, so in the same Google Doc with your competitive analysis research, you

time-off request policy easily digestible for new hires. You open the Google Doc with the handbook. You prompt 

Gemini in Docs by selecting Help me write. You type: 

Generate a step-by-step checklist summarizing the company’s time-off request policy. Ensure it is written 

in plain language and easy for employees to understand. (Gemini in Docs)

Leveling up your prompt writing

This guide is meant to serve as inspiration, and the possibilities are nearly endless with Gemini for Google 

Workspace. Build on your prompt-writing skills using these tips.

•  Break it up. If you want Gemini for Workspace to perform several related tasks, break them into  

separate prompts.

•  Give constraints. To generate specific results, include details in your prompt such as character count limits 

or the number of options you’d like to generate.

•  Assign a role. To encourage creativity, assign a role. You can do this by starting your prompt with language 

like: “You are the head of a creative department for a leading advertising agency …” 

•  Ask for feedback. In your conversation with Gemini Advanced, tell it that you’re giving it a project, include all 

the relevant details, and then describe the output you want. Continue the conversation by asking questions 

like, “What questions do you have for me that would help you provide the best output?”

•  Consider tone. Tailor your prompts to suit your intended audience. Ask for outputs to have a specific tone, 

such as formal, informal, technical, creative, or casual.

•  Say it another way. Fine-tune your prompts if the results don’t meet your expectations or if you believe 

there’s room for improvement. An iterative process of review and refinement often yields better results.

Generative AI and all of its possibilities are exciting, but it’s still new.  
Even though our models are getting better every day, prompts can 
sometimes have unpredictable responses.

Before putting an output from Gemini for Workspace into action, review 
it to ensure clarity, relevance, and accuracy. And of course, keep the 
most important thing in mind: Generative AI is meant to help humans,  
but the final output is yours.

The example prompts in this guide are meant for illustrative purposes.
