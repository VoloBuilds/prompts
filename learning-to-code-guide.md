 The following tips match what was covered in the AI Coding 101 episode, but the [LearnToCode.md](LearnToCode.md) page contains more detailed prompts and a technology glossary.

 #### 31. Tell AI to keep it simple + that you are a new dev

 **Example:**
 ```
 I am learning how to code. Can you simply explain how the frontend connects to the backend?
 ```

 #### 32. Ask AI to explain code "line by line"

 **Prompt:**
 ```
 Please add comments explaining [function] line by line
 ```

 **Example:**
