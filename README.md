## Getting Started

1. **Master LLM Communication First**:
   - Start with [LLM Communication Techniques](llm-communication-techniques-for-developers.md) to learn how to structure thoughts and communicate effectively with AI assistants
   - This foundational skill will improve your experience with all other guides

2. **Choose your guide based on your role**:
   - Browse the [Job-Specific Prompts Index](job-specific-prompts-index.md) to find guides tailored to your technology stack and responsibilities
   - Use general guides for learning fundamentals or cross-cutting concerns

3. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<USERNAME>/<REPO>.git
   cd <REPO>
   ```

4. **Open the relevant guides** in your preferred Markdown viewer or editor

## Usage

Copy and paste the prompts from these guides into your AI coding assistant (e.g., ChatGPT,
Claude Sonnet, GitHub Copilot) to accelerate learning, development, and troubleshooting.

### Example Workflow
1. **Learn effective communication** using the LLM Communication Techniques guide
2. **Identify your role and tech stack** using the job-specific index
