# User Stories for AI Coding Prompt Guides

This document outlines the key user personas and their primary goals for using the AI Coding Prompt Guides repository.

## 1. New Developer / Learner
- As a beginner learning to code, I want a curated set of AI prompts that explain fundamental programming concepts, so that I can build confidence and foundational knowledge.
- As a learner, I want line-by-line explanations and simple examples, so that complex ideas become accessible and memorable.

## 2. Feature Developer
- As a developer building new functionality, I want robust feature prompt templates, so that I can generate production-ready code with error handling and unit tests quickly.

- As a troubleshooter, I want guidance on adding logs and interpreting outputs (The Beaver Method), so that I can systematically debug complex flows.

## 5. Continuous Learner
- As a continuous learner, I want deep-dive prompts into specific technologies and best practices, so that I can expand my skill set and adopt industry-standard approaches.

## 6. Contributor / Collaborator
- As a contributor, I want clear contribution guidelines and scenario-based templates, so that I can easily propose changes or add new prompts aligned with the project structure.

## 7. Project Owner / Maintainer
